The increase in these metrics spreads throughout the network, stressing session management and connectivity.\n- **Session Initiation**: Pod-specific activities show recurring session initiations, potentially revealing inefficiencies in managing or processing multiple access requests efficiently.\n- **Stability with Fluctuations**: While logs generally appeared stable in context, detailed metric analysis reveals background fluctuations suggesting higher systemic network load or configuration demands.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Network Monitoring Enhancement**: Implement deeper monitoring and logging for all network-related requests and activities to pinpoint specific network stress points and balance load across pods efficiently.\n\n2. **Traffic Balancing**: Evaluate traffic balancing configurations to ensure optimal distribution of network packets and session requests, reducing the chance of bottlenecks or latency.\n\n3. **Session Management Optimization**: Develop or refine session management processes to better handle spikes and excess session creations without stressing network capacities.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Log Capture**: Enhance log capturing capabilities to ensure all potentially useful data is retained for better root cause analysis, especially during peak activity windows.\n\n5. **Repeat Anomaly Scans**: Perform additional anomaly analysis using a revised collection of metrics to continuously improve system response and resilience.\n\nThese targeted strategies aim to address and mitigate identified issues while enhancing overall system performance and stability."
